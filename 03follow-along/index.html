            <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>

            <p> Unlike the other founding documents, the Declaration of Independence is not legally binding, but <strong>it is powerful.</strong> Abraham Lincoln called it “a rebuke and a stumbling-block to tyranny and oppression.” It continues to inspire people around the world to fight for freedom and equality.</p>
            
            <p><a href="signers.html#sign">We hold these truths</a> to be <em>self-evident</em>, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
